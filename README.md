# Shanmuka Sadhu Coding & Programming National FBLA 2020

This year for Coding & Programming FBLA competition, the task was to create a computer program that tracked Community Service Awards program in your local chapter. My program checked off all of the requirements provided on the FBLA website. The program is able to add, uptdate, and delete students from a dynamic database. Also, service hours are able to be allocated towards students. Reports are generated on a monthly basis and a weekly basis. The login, logout, and signup options allow for the application to be secure and personal only to the user. Overall, this application is easy to use and very efficient for the user.
